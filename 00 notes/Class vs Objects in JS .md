# Class vs Objects in JS

1. According to Oracle’s [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html), in object-oriented-programming, an [object](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html) “stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages). Methods operate on an object’s internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication”. A [class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html), then, is “the blueprint from which individual objects are created”.
