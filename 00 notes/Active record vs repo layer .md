# Active record vs repo layer

Advantages of the Active Record Pattern:

1. **Simplicity**: It can simplify the codebase by encapsulating both the data structure (model/schema) and data manipulation methods in a single place.
2. **Familiarity**: Developers who are more accustomed to ORMs and frameworks like Mongoose or Sequelize may find this pattern more familiar and easier to work with.

Disadvantages and Considerations:

1. **Mixing Concerns**: The active record pattern tends to mix concerns by combining data manipulation methods with the data structure definition. This can lead to larger and potentially less maintainable model files, especially as the application grows.
2. **Testability**: It can be more challenging to test the data manipulation methods in isolation because they are tightly coupled with the database. In contrast, using a separate repository layer allows you to mock or stub the repository in tests, providing more control and flexibility.
3. **Code Reusability**: Separating the data manipulation logic into a repository layer allows you to reuse that logic across different parts of your application or even across different applications.
4. **Cluttered Models**: As your application grows and you add more methods to your models, the models can become cluttered and harder to navigate. A separate repository layer can help keep models focused on data structure.
5. **Persistence Layer Abstraction**: Using a repository layer provides an abstraction over the persistence layer, making it easier to switch to a different database system in the future because you only need to update the repository layer rather than changing every model directly.
6. **Modularity and Scalability**: Separating the data logic into a repository layer makes the code more modular and scalable. It's easier to manage and extend your application when each component has a well-defined purpose and responsibilities.
